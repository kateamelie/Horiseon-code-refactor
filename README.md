# Horiseon code refactor

## Description

This was my first week's homework assignment, and my first time refactoring code!
I had a straight forward time editing the HTML elements into semantic elements and organizing the code by adding comments.
Semantic HTML elements allows for better search engine optimization and reader accessibility (i.e. a screen reader can now read the title of each element!"
The harder part for me was figuring the css. The css style sheet is definitely something I will work on further for next week's assignment.


## Installation

-GitHub account and web browser (I recommend Google Chrome)
-VS Code installed on your mac or windows, if you wanted to view the files from your local machine

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
